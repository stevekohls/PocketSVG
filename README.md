# PocketSVG
A library that converts Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) data into CAShapeLayers and UIBezierPaths. This makes it easy to create vector-based paths and shapes in your apps. 

This a fork of a fork of an [SVG to bezier path parser by Martin Haywood](http://ponderwell.net/2011/05/converting-svg-paths-to-objective-c-paths/), with fixes by [Pieter Omvlee](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/) and Dominic Mortlock.
Further improvements by Steve Kohls.

This fork includes:
* Support for SVG \<line\> and \<polyline\> elements.
* Support for more than one \<path\>, \<line\> and \<polyline\> per file.
* Designated initializers to support SVG input from a variety of sources.

General improvements:
* Added [RaptureXML](https://github.com/ZaBlanc/RaptureXML) to support easier SVG parsing.
* Improved \<path\> parsing to be more robust.

Feedback, improvements, and pull requests are welcome. Please get in touch if you can help improve the code. 

## Usage
1. Draw your bezier path in a vector graphics editor such as Illustrator, Inkscape, [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), etc.
1. Save as an SVG.
1. Drag and drop it into your Xcode project.
1. Follow these easy steps:

```obj-c
    //1: Create a PocketSVG object from your SVG file:
    PocketSVG *myBezier = [[PocketSVG alloc] initFromSVGFileNamed:@"BezierCurve1-iPad"];
    
    //2: Its bezier property is the corresponding UIBezierPath:
    UIBezierPath *myPath = [myBezier.beziers objectAtIndex:0];
    
    //3: To display it on screen, create a CAShapeLayer and set 
    //the CGPath property of the above UIBezierPath as its path:
    CAShapeLayer *myShapeLayer = [CAShapeLayer layer];
    myShapeLayer.path = myPath.CGPath;
    
    //4: Fiddle with it using CAShapeLayer's properties:
    myShapeLayer.strokeColor = [[UIColor redColor] CGColor];
    myShapeLayer.lineWidth = 4;
    myShapeLayer.fillColor = [[UIColor clearColor] CGColor];
    
    //5: Display it!
    [self.view.layer addSublayer:myShapeLayer];
```
Don't forget to add the __QuartzCore__ framework to your project ([here's how](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3377682/1072846)) and import it:
```obj-c
#import <QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h>
```

## Useful Documentation
* [An SVG's d attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathElement) – from the SVG specification 
* [UIBezierPaths](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html) - Class Reference 
* [CAShapeLayers](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CAShapeLayer_class/Reference/Reference.html) - Class Reference. Tells you which properties of the shape/path can be manipulated. 
* [Drawing Shapes Using Bezier Paths](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/2ddrawing/conceptual/drawingprintingios/BezierPaths/BezierPaths.html) - From Apple's Drawing and Printing Guide for iOS

## Latest Fixes
* Fixed problem that causes SVGs to render with wrong frame dimensions.
* Fixed problem that causes some SVGs to render incorrectly.
* Fixed parse bug for SVGs with blank spaces in them (thanks to [mindbrix](https://github.com/mindbrix)).
* Simplified PocketSVG's init method (thanks to [johnnyknox](https://github.com/johnnyknox)).

## To Do
* Generate NSBezierPaths as well as UIBezierPaths
* Make it a category on CAShapeLayer?
